ft_linear_regression is a 42's project that aims to recreate a linear regression from scratch.

To run the project you need Python 3.12 and run the following commands:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
```

When it's done, add a CSV file containing your data (like data.csv that is provided) and run:
```bash
python main.py
```
